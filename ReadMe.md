This code is using the Alchemy SDK to interact with the Ethereum blockchain on the Goerli testnet. It imports several modules from the Alchemy SDK, including the Alchemy class, Network enum, Wallet class, and Utils class. It also uses the dotenv library to load environment variables for the test API key and private key. It creates an instance of the Alchemy class with the test API key and Goerli network, and an instance of the Wallet class with the test private key.

The main function is where the core functionality of the code resides. It first gets the nonce (number of previous transactions sent from a specific address) for the wallet's address using the getTransactionCount method. Then, it creates a transaction object with various properties, including the recipient address, value, gas limit, maximum priority fee per gas, maximum fee per gas, nonce, type, and chain id.

The signTransaction method is used to sign the transaction with the wallet's private key, resulting in a raw transaction. This raw transaction is then sent to the blockchain using the sendTransaction method and the resulting transaction hash is logged to the console along with the transaction url on Goerli Etherscan.
